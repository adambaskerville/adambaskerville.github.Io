I am currently a research fellow (EPSRC funded, EP/R011265/1) at the University of Sussex working in collaboration with Bristol university studying fundamental effects of electron correlation in many-particle systems. This covers a wide range of topics from quantum mechanics, mathematical, theoretical and computational physics and quantum chemistry. 

## Education

* 2014 - 2018: PhD in Quantum Chemical Physics, The University of Sussex, UK, "The few-particle quantum chemical physics of atoms and molecules."
* 2010 - 2014: Master of Physics and Astrophysics, The University of kent, UK.
