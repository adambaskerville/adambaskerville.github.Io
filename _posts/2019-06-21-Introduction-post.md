Nearly everyone has had influential teachers throughout their school years. I can list several notable candidates, but truthfully the best teacher has always been the internet. It is something a lot of us take for granted, and seldom utilise to its fullest potential.

I aim to try and give back to the community, posting about scientific, mathematical and programming related problems that I encounter in my research and how I overcome them. This will hopefully lead to a post library which people can benefit from. The blog is called Textbook to Terminal or T > T for short making a bad pun out of the bash redirection command `>`. There is often a large disconnect between published mathematics/science and how to program it effectively.
