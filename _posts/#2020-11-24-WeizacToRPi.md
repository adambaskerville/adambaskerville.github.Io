In 1949, Chaim, L, Pekeris a mathematician and geophysicist received a reply to a letter he sent to John Von Neumann, the foremost mathematician of the time, regarding a discussion on the properties of the helium atom:

"*The differential equations which you give as determining the problem of Helium II do not look vicious. How bad are they from the numerical point of view? They should certainly not be bad for high-speed computer. Quite apart from more ambitious devices, the ENIAC or the SSEC, 33 or the Harvard Mark II or III should be sufficient here ... It would certainly be good to discuss these and other similar problems personally when you are here.*"

Pekeris would later go on to develop an ingenious method of numerically solving the time independent, non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the helium atom, where he used the Weizmann Automatic Computer, **WEIZAC**, the first computer built in Israel.

In this post we are going to write a Python program to replicate Pekeris' method and run it on the Â£9, 6cm wide **Raspberry Pi zero W** computer, a far cry from the room sized behemoth WEIZAC which in the 1950s cost $50,000 - equivalent to approximately half a million dollars in today's money.

First question, **what is a series solution?** It is a means of solving differential equations by assuming the solution is a power series
